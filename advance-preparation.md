# 1. Sign up for GitHub

1. Visit https://github.com/ and pick a username to set up an account. Youâ€™ll probably use
GitHub long past this class, so bear that in mind when deciding what email
address to give.

2. Give us your username so we can invite you to join the `galastrostats` organization.

3. Visit https://github.com/galastrostats to accept the invitation to join the team
`students2016`.

# 2. Install Git

Git is pre-installed on all linux machines. Install git for your laptop from one of these links:

1. [Install for MacOS](https://git-scm.com/download/mac)
2. [Install for Win](https://git-for-windows.github.io) -- all defaults are fine except you may prefer to decline credential manager
