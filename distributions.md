# Histograms, Kernel Density Estimation, and Hypothesis Tests for Comparing Distributions

This activity will focus on displaying and comparing distributions. We'll also use an efficient algorithm for nearest neighbor searches. The relevant textbook sections are: 4.8.1 and 5.7.2 on histograms and the Scott/Freedman-Diaconis/Knuth/Bayesian blocks rules for bin size, 6.1.1 on Kernel Density Estimation (KDE), 4.7.2 on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and alternatives, and 2.5.2 on nearest neighbor searches.

(also with an example of vectorization for code speedup on pp. 54-56
