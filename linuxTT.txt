if your processes run under "screen" are slowing down: 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
0) Log into whatever machine you want to run the job. 
1) Create a new PAG by running "pagsh -c /bin/tcsh" PAG stands for process authentication group. This way you can start a set of processes that share the same authentication token and they are isolated from your other processes. 
2) start a new screen session 
3) run "reauth" You will be prompted for your password, which will be used to renew your tokens periodically. Remember the PID that reauth tell you, or figure it out later using "ps aux | grep youronyengoeshere" 
4) start python and run job 
5) detach by ctrl-a d and log out (which leaves that pagsh) 
6) later reconnect with a new login (which obviously doesn't know about the old pagsh) and screen -dR 
7) When you are done, kill the PID and exit out of screen and pagsh.
